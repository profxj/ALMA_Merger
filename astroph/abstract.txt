We present high spatial-resolution (~2kpc) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter 
Array (ALMA) observations of CII 158um and dust-continuum emission from a galaxy at z=3.7978
selected by its strong HI absorption (a damped Lya absorber, DLA) against a background QSO. 
Our ALMA images reveal a pair of star-forming galaxies separated by ~6kpc 
(projected) undergoing a major merger. Between these galaxies is a third emission component 
with highly elevated (2x)
CII 158um emission relative to the dust continuum, which is likely to arise 
from stripped gas associated with the merger. This merger of two otherwise-normal galaxies 
is not accompanied by enhanced star-formation, contrary to mergers detected in most 
luminosity-selected samples. The DLA associated with the merger exhibits extreme kinematics, 
with a velocity width for the low-ionization metal lines of dv90~470 km/s, that 
spans the velocity spread revealed in the CII 158um emission. We propose that DLAs with high 
dv90 values are a signpost of major mergers in normal galaxies at high redshifts, and 
use the distribution of the velocity widths of metal lines in high-z DLAs to provide
a rough estimate the fraction of z>3 galaxies that are undergoing a major merger.
